				<li>Rivers in hell
				  <ul>
					<li>Abhorred Styx, the flood of deadly hate
					<li>Sad Acheron of sorrow, black and deep;
					<li>Cocytus , named of lamentation loud
					<li>Heard on the rueful stream; fierce Phlegethon,
					<li>Whose waves of torrent fire inflame with rage.
					<li>Far off from these, a slow and silent stream,
					<li>Lethe, the river of oblivion, rolls
					<li>Her watery labyrinth, whereof who drinks
					<li>Forthwith his former state and being forgets,
					<li>Forgets both joy and grief, pleasure and pain.
				  </ul>
				<li>'famous quote' (in sandman among others),..
				  <ul>
					<li>The mind is it's own place, and in itself
					<li>Can make a Heaven of Hell, a Hell of Heaven.
					<li>What matter where, if I be still the same,
					<li>And what I should be, all but less than he
					<li>Whom thunder hath made greater? Here at least
					<li>We shall be free; the Almighty hath not built
					<li>Here for his envy, will not drive us hence;
					<li>Here we may reign secure, and, in my choice,
					<li>To reign is worth ambition, though in Hell:
					<li>Better to reign in Hell than serve in Heaven.

	<li>the future of hnb
	  <ul>
		<li>at the moment the curses version is nearing feature completion, I will most probably make a gtk+ port of it.
		<li>I have vague vaporware plans to make it into an collaborative, tool,.. seperating all of the interface completely from the backend, and making http, gtk+, curses, and perhaps some soap or someting client for it.
