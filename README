HIERARCHICAL NOTEBOOK
 
hierarchical notebook (hnb) is program to organize, many kinds
of data in one place, for example adresses, todo lists, ideas,
book "reviews", brainstorming, organizing a speech, making a 
structured packing list random notes, and probably many more I 
haven't thought of yet..
	
 
HOW TO GET hnb?
	
	new releases of hnb will appear on the
	sourceforge project page
		http://sourceforge.net/projects/hnb
	
INSTALLING hnb
	
	if you've got a source release you must first compile
	hnb,.. see further down in this file for instructions.
	
	Windows
		the windows binary distribution, is a .zip file
		containing the executable, this readme file, 
		an sample database, and the licence for hnb's use.
		
		the binary is standalone, so you can just
		copy it wherever you'd like it to reside.
		
	Linux
		the linux binary distribution is a .tar.gz file
		containing the executable, this readme file, a
		an sample database, and the licence for hnb's use.
		
		the binary is dynamically linked against ncurses
		just place it anywere in your path.. like
		/usr/bin, /usr/local/bin or /home/user/bin
		
COMPILING hnb
	
	I've only tried to compile hnb using linux, the only dependencies are
	ncurses so it should compile on most any unix by just typing make.
	
	I cross compile the win32 binary using mingw32, the Makefile is
	probably a mess by most standards, but it works for me (tm), and
	will be replaced by something more appropriate at some other time.
	
USAGE DOCUMENTATION
	
	hopefully hnb is quite selfdocumenting, but the file sample.hnb
	contains some explaination of concepts and ideas behind hnb
	invoke hnb like this to look at the file.

	[ ]curses interface
		[ ]in editing mode, use reverse video as cursor instead of _ hack
		[ ]copy node and substree
	[ ]todo
		[X]the autochecking of parental nodes kinda works for one level now,.. must create either an recursive maintainance routine,.. or something ingenious
		[ ]the recurisive auto done tag matcher,..
			if there is a parent
				check wether all todo boxes in this level is checked
				if they are. check parent, else uncheck parent
					repeat until there is no parent
