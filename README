hierarchical notebook (hnb) is program to organize, many kinds
of data in one place,  for example  adresses, todo lists, ideas,
book "reviews", brainstorming, and probably many more I haven't
thought of yet..
	
HOW TO GET hnb?
	
	new releases of hnb will appear on the
	<a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/hnb">sourceforge project page</a>
	
	
INSTALLING hnb
	
	if you've got a source release you must first compile
	hnb,.. see further down in this file for instructions.
	
	Windows
		the windows binary distribution, is a .zip file
		containing the executable, this readme file, 
		an sample database, and the licence for hnb's use.
		
		the binary is standalone, so you can just
		copy it wherever you'd like it to reside.
		
	Linux
		the linux binary distribution is a .tar.gz file
		containing the executable, this readme file, a
		an sample database, and the licence for hnb's use.
		
		the binary is dynamically linked against ncurses
		just place it anywere in your path.. like
		/usr/bin, /usr/local/bin or /home/user/bin
		
COMPILING hnb
	
	I've only tried to compile hnb using Slackware 7.1,
	but I think it should compile on any unix by
	just typing make.
	
	I cross compile the win32 binary using mingw32, and
	pdcurses,.. to do this might call for some modifications
	of the makefile, this version have not been tested for a while and might be more buggy than worth experiencing.
	
USAGE DOCUMENTATION
	
	instructions for the usage of hnb is contained in
	the sample.hnb database file, invoke hnb like this
	in the distribution directory to get further documentation
	
	hnb sample.hnb
	
FOR APPLICATION/GAME DEVELOPERS
	
	take a look at registry.h and reg.c, like what you see?
	please use it in gnu GPL programs
	
TODO
	recursive substring search
	moving
		make the selected node, be dragged instead of warped
	text "overflowing" into help/status area,..
	the confirm menu.. also changes the current node temporarily,.. 
		because of input buffer not handled according to drawmode I think,..
	"symbolic links"
	buffer limits
		is now increased to 2048, but is it enough?
	different collapse modes?
	keyboard handling
		tell the user that... key ????? not defined in current mode
		or perhaps to stderr or something
	sdl
	wordwrap
		if there is only one long word on the line (url),..
		the wrapping doesn't work like it should
