HIERARCHICAL NOTEBOOK
	
	hierarchical notebook (hnb) is program to organize, many kinds of data
	in one place, for example adresses, todo lists, ideas, book "reviews",
	brainstorming, organizing a speech, making a  structured packing list 
	random notes, and probably many more I  haven't thought of yet..
	

HOW TO GET hnb?
	new releases and information about hnb will appear at hnb's homepage
	
	http://sourceforge.net/projects/hnb/
	
INSTALLING hnb
	if you've got a source release you must first compile hnb,..
	see further down in this file for instructions.
	
	Windows
		the windows binary distribution, is a .zip file	containing the
		executable, this readme file, an sample database, and the 
		licence for hnb's use. the binary is standalone, so you can 
		just copy it wherever you'd like it to reside.
	Linux 
		the linux binary distribution is a .tar.gz file	containing the
		executable, this readme file, a an sample database, and the
		licence for hnb's use. The binary is dynamically linked 
		against ncurses just place it anywere in your path.. like
		/usr/bin, /usr/local/bin or /home/user/bin
		
COMPILING hnb
	
	hnb uses automake/autoconf installing it is as simple as:
	
	./configure
	make
	su
	(enter root password)
	make install
	
	
USAGE DOCUMENTATION
	If you start hnb without any parameters and no default database, or
	with the -t or --tutorial option, hnb will load a special tutorial
	database.

BUGS
	slashes (/) inside nodes are not escaped correctly in cli mode
	bullets/todo boxes, doesn't check that the line is writeable (top of screen on multiline nodes)
TODO
	buffer limits
		they are high,.. but a really long node might crash it
	more entities on each node
		current entities:
			priority
			title/data
			todo item
			done/not done
		future items:
			created date
			modified date
			due date, for project planning
			details dialog for each node to modify such things
			cronological id
	purge todo items on lower levels
	shuffle action
	curses interface
		"context" menu for mouse mode
	cli interface
		make '/' inside node names appear correctly in pwd, and prompt
		maybe avoiding static buffers is even more important here than in the curses version (due to possible scripted input),.. but then I'd have to fix path.c as well.. <g>
	gtk 2.0
		start
	how to implement cloning
		linked list
			add a flag called ghost
			add a Node *ghost; var to all nodes.
			the node that sets up the symlink is set F_ghost, and Node *Right points to the children of the original node.
			the destination points it's Node *ghost to the node that referred to it.
			if a new ghost is made of any of the two other nodes, it sets it's own F_ghost attribute. Follows the links to the originating ghost, (->child -> parent) sets it's *right node pointing to it, follows the *ghost link until the 0, and hooks itself in there.
			when removing the original node you reparent the children to the next node in the link list, and removes the F_ghost attribute from that node.
			when removing one of the ghosts, you must tidy up the ghost link list, and free that node(but none of it's data)
		in the ascii data format just say node_no(link) is linked here
		the userinterface should have no notion of it's path,.. but perhaps a node history...
		functions that must be changed
			node_swap
				if a node with F_ghost is moved, don't reparent children.
			subtree_copy
				nahh, tough one,.. just make a duplicate that isn't linked with the rest? TBD
			node_recurse
				ignore ghosts thereby avoiding loops
			node_backrecurse
			node_insert_up
			node_insert_down
			node_remove
	make a dead tree copy of the source for examination
		enscript *.h *.c -E  --output uts.ps -U 2 -j
	backspace/delete behaviour, experiment to find good solution
	win32 port
		make sure it works
		check key behaviour
	html export
		make the html legal,.. ( <li> overnode <ul> <li>hei </li><li>der</li> </li> )
