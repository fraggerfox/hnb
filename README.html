<BODY>
<UL>
	<LI>HIERARCHICAL NOTEBOOK
	  <UL>
		<LI>hierarchical notebook (hnb) is program to organize, many kinds of data in one place, for example adresses, todo lists, ideas, book "reviews", brainstorming, organizing a speech, making a  structured packing list random notes, and probably many more I  haven't thought of yet..
	  </UL>
	<LI>HOW TO GET hnb?
	  <UL>
		<LI>new releases of hnb will appear on the sourceforge project page http://sourceforge.net/projects/hnb/
	  </UL>
	<LI>INSTALLING hnb
	  <UL>
		<LI>if you've got a source release you must first compile hnb,.. see further down in this file for instructions.
		<LI>Windows
		  <UL>
			<LI>the windows binary distribution, is a .zip file	containing the executable, this readme file, an sample database, and the licence for hnb's use.
			<LI>the binary is standalone, so you can just copy it wherever you'd like it to reside.
		  </UL>
		<LI>Linux 
		  <UL>
			<LI>the linux binary distribution is a .tar.gz file	containing the executable, this readme file, a an sample database, and the licence for hnb's use.
			<LI>the binary is dynamically linked against ncurses just place it anywere in your path.. like /usr/bin, /usr/local/bin or /home/user/bin
		  </UL>
	  </UL>
	<LI>COMPILING hnb
	  <UL>
		<LI>I've only tried to compile hnb using linux, the only dependencies are ncurses so it should compile on most any unix by just typing make.
		<LI>I cross compile the win32 binary using mingw32, the Makefile is probably a mess by most standards, but it works for me (tm), and will be replaced by something more appropriate at some other time.
	  </UL>
	<LI>USAGE DOCUMENTATION
	  <UL>
		<LI>If you start hnb without any parameters and no default database, or with the -t or --tutorial option, hnb will load a special tutorial database.
	  </UL>
